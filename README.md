# watermark-setter
version 1.0
Photoshop version : 21.x (and surely below)

This Adobe Photoshop script is used to set a watermark at a corner of all opened images.
In addition, you can specify an offset for your watermark / signature or anything you want.
You will also be able to choose the layer you want to use as the watermark.

## Interface
The script has a pretty simple user interface. Quite handy when you need more flexibility.
- Offset settings: Determine the X and Y value for the offset of your watermark in the corner. You have the possibility to link both values
*Good to know: the offset is computed depending the selected corner. You may prefer ask yourself "from how many pixels of the corner do I want to set my watermark"*
*Example: the top-right corner is selected, then [x, y] offset will translate the watermark to the [left, down] by default*
- Corner selection: Determine in which corner you want to set your watermark
- Layer dropdown: Used to select the layer to use as watermark
